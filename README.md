# ZoarialBareOS

This is a project to learn about the low-level workings of computers.
This is purely a passion project with no real end-goal in mind. 
Most of the work done will be inspired by the pages on wiki.osdev.org and will be tailored to my specific needs.

## Potential additions in no particular order
* USB Keyboard support - I don't have a PS/2 keyboard
* View system resources - ram, cpu, etc
* UEFI support
* Create a custom bootloader
